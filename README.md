We discovered that T cells at low and high density display low- and high-migration phenotypes, respectively. The highly migratory phenotype was mediated by a paracrine pathway from a group of self-produced cytokines. We exploited this finding to “lock-in” a highly migratory phenotype by developing and expressing synthetic receptors, creating velocity receptors (VRs). To investigate the transcriptomic profiles of VR-CAR T cells, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on both basal unstimulated and antigen-specific activated CAR T cells generated from the same donor.
